A program that allows users to decrypt files. The file encryption technique that was used to encrypt the file is a Caesar cipher.  A Caesar Cipher works by shifting all the letters in the file by a certain amount.  So for a file with an encryption key of 1 an “a” will be represented by a “b”, and a “b” will be represented by a “c” in the encrypted file.  With an encryption key of 2, an “a” will be represented by a “c”, and a “b” will be represented by a “d” in the encrypted file.

2 Encrypted files:
  - ring.txt
  - mariner.txt
